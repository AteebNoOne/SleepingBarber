# SleepingBarber
In computer science, the sleeping barber problem is a classic inter-process communication and synchronization problem that illustrates the complexities that arise when there are multiple operating system processes.

The problem was originally proposed in 1965 by computer science pioneer Edsger Dijkstra, who used it to make the point that general semaphores are often superfluous.

These are my codes where I simplified the Sleeping barber problem WITHOUT using semaphores.
These codes are good for academic purpose.
They can be good example for students willing to search C/C++ Code for Sleeping Barber Operating System Synchronization Problem.
